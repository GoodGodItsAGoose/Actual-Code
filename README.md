Convoluted Message Encryptor is a small file that I made with the help of a peer, and is a program to encrypt and decrypt messages without saving your info.
The idea behind this is that you would input a message you want encrypted, choose a level of security, then give the encrypted message and the level of encryption to the recipient, who would then use this same program to decrypt it.
So far, this is not an app or a webpage. You must download the file in order to use it. I do plan to eventually get this to at least a webpage to use.

Features:
 - Encrypting or decrypting messages with 5 levels of encryption.
 - Encrypting or decrypting files.
 - Saving the encrypted or decrypted file to either the same file, or a new file.
 - Copying the encrypted message to the clipboard.

This program does not save any information you input into it. If you close it before finishing or close it without saving messages, you cannot recover them without going through the process again.
Please do not use this to harass or abuse others, and please use wisely. This was made by a rather inexperienced python user, so keep that in mind.
